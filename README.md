- 👋 Hi, I’m @ItemHunt, a self-taught beginner programmer who is trying to understand how to do programmer stuff. Been programming and studying for more than 5 months already. 
- 👀 I’m interested in studying computer related stuff, gaming, and Linux.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of stuff like Linux, C++, Javascript, GDScript, and networking. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects that I can work on and learn from. I can't do hard projects yet, only easy-to-understand projects related to what I know. 
- 📫 You can reach me via my discord LittleTrick#2649 but please, approach me via email first before Discord. Here is my email LittleHunters@proton.me
