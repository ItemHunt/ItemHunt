- 👋 Hi, I’m @ItemHunt, a beginner programmer who is trying to understand how to do programmer stuff. 
- 👀 I’m interested in studying computer related stuff, gaming, and Linux.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of stuff like Linux, C++, Javascript, GDScript, and networking. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects that I can do and learn from. I can't do big and easy-to-understand projects, I am busy with school and other stuff a lot of the time. 
- 📫 You can reach me via my discord LittleTrick#2649
